# YegnaNet
Our network: by us, for us.


1. The Problem

In Ethiopia, and in many regions across Africa, access to reliable public WiFi remains both limited and undocuments. Navigating a city like Addis Ababa can often mean wandering from café to café, only to discover that promised internet connectivity doesn’t exist or is barely usable. Addis Ababa, a growing tech hub in East Africa, is filled with cafés, libraries, and shops that offer WiFi—but there is no centralized or reliable map of where these connections exist, how strong or secure they are, or whether they’re even active. 

For our vast and beautiful country-side communities, WiFi is even more sparse. But even in areas where hotspots exist, word-of-mouth remains the main way people discover where to go online. I felt there's a clear opportunity to build something helpful, accessible, and community-driven. 

Africa’s internet user base is growing rapidly. Ethiopia is frequently cited as a future leader in African tech. A more connected Ethiopia empowers business, education, communication, and innovation. As billions more join the internet, tools like YegnaNet can help shape that transition in a way that centers equity, transparency, and usability.

2. Our Vision
   
YegnaNet is your pocket companion for finding WiFi.

We envision an Ethiopia where:

- Anyone can locate nearby, reliable, public internet access

- Diaspora can return home without feeling disconnected

- Students and remote workers know where they can study and work without interruption

- Communication through apps like WhatsApp and Viber are accessible without burning through expensive    prepaid minutes

3. Our Approach

YegnaNet will be:

Crowdsourced: Users submit and verify WiFi locations and updates. Shop owners or library staff can flag outages or new availability. This turns every user into a potential contributor.

Offline-first: Travelers can preload city data and still access the map without an active connection. This is essential in regions with patchy or inconsistent service.

Educational: Through optional in-app literacy modules, users can learn how to browse safely, avoid malicious actors, and understand the basics of internet hygiene—especially helpful for first-time internet users.

4. Our Values
YegnaNet is grounded in:

- Community: Built for and with Ethiopians and our abundant diaspora

- Transparency: Users verify each other’s submissions, and all updates are open

- Digital equity: Access to the internet should not depend on who you know or where you live

We are committed to:

- Multilingual support (Amharic, English, and others as we grow)

- Exploring open access and open-source contributions in future phases

Ultimately this project isn’t about monetizing connectivity, it’s about unlocking opportunity. This project is unique because it combines practical utility with educational empowerment. It hasn’t been done at scale in Ethiopia before, and we hope it sparks a wave of digital confidence and connectivity.
